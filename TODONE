The whole day, listened to Hrvoje Klasnic Kontrapovijest and layed out the board.
At some point I more or less laid it out again. And made it so I can put the milkv module 01 on the lower board and have only additional peripherals on the upper board. Also made a possibility to make a thin but long device with a two board sandwich. 

Sat the whole day doing that. Drank a few drinks in the evening with Mirna and her posse. Now I think I can do the pcb tracks before going to bed.

I moved around components a bit a couple more times. 

I will make another round, trying to lower number of different components
	- X 33nF filter cap can go to 100n - low pass goes from 4.8kHz to 1.6kHz - maybe I can lower the resistor a bit with a different value - there is a 510R resistor used
	- X there are two different 100k resistors - check that 
	- X pp pullup can be 510r
	- X all current limit resistors can go from 1k to 510ohm
	- X board version selection resistors can go from 100k to 10k
	- X 20k + 10k voltage divider 5V->3V3

Routed the whole board. 
Fucked up the library, the footprints and the 3d models were still linked to the old JLCPCB folder, need to fix that. - fixed
DRC is mostly ok, need to fix parts of it up. 
Maybe move to a bigger DRV chip? - no
Check Relay holes again.

Prepare for the order.

Had a primary run on JLCPCB - ~150eur 5 pcb 2 assembled.

First pass component placing is done. The size of the board and the upper board have been set. 

Stuff to do before the layout is done.
	X Set up library properly
	X Set up track sizes
	X Set up all 3d objects
	X Set up DRC
	- Figure out how a label can be brought from schematic to pcb - it can not!
	X Put tracks

Finalized the schematic. 
Decided on all components. 
Started first pass layout.

Still need to check all pinouts

Don't like the current squarness of the board.

-- 22.07.2024 --
Schematic is done. 
Next steps are, 
	finding the components, preferably on jlcpcb. 
	Then selecting, finding, drawing footprints. 
	Then lower pcb layout.

Did some work on figuring out openamp. 

-- 21.07.2024 --
Finished all the work to wrapup with my last work. Been working more and more.
Schematic is around 80% done. Working on the sw architecture in parallel a bit, trying to get how to setup and use remoteproc.

I have quit my day job, so I can now start more intensive with this. !!!

	PCB lower plan:
		get general schematic set with chips and values selected
		create the components
		regenerate the schematic with propper components
		route the board

		+ route a quick upper adapter board adapting duos and duo to the lower connector.

Boards have arrived. Gave both to Dpavlin. Gave duo256 to Plejic. 

Played with them a little bit. Read up on the mailbox and surounding functionalities. 
Built image with nixos. Experimented with "official" buildroot image and a debian image. 
Think will continue with the debian image.

Flow to do stuff

	build image
	build freertos binary for the other core
	start/stop execution on the small core
	change control of the pins from the linux core - device tree
	communicate between two cores
	figure out how would the full system be updated?

	start building the actual code for the EVSE

	PCB - lower
	finish the schematic
	update all schematic symbols and add pcb symbols
	route the pcb

	PCB - upper
	start with just an adapter for duos?
	start with schematic
		peripherals?
		usb
		ethernet
		lower board connector
		serial port
		sd-card + emcc footprint 
		wifi + bt? - skip on first version
		pcb version pins 
		couple of leds 
			power ( all rails? first version )
			couple for control ( linux, rtos ) - 4 pcs
		buttons
			boot
			reset
			additional for programming, at least two

	fix core selector to riscv?
	fix usb functionality to usb client only?
	
	PCB in general
	focus on jlcpcb parts?

THE BOARDS HAVE ARRIVED!!!

scp-ing to the device needs -O option

/dev/cvi-rtos-cmdqu is missing in the current latest image will try 1.0.9

Sent the inquiry email to Bituo. Looking into schematic. Ultra librarian is bullshit. 

-- 31-05-2024 --

Started with making the schematic outline. Just outline, so no pcb footprints, no particular values, no new symbols, etc. 

Need to send an email to bituo technic, to order RCD module, and see if they are going to be available in bulk. And also see how much is it going to cost. If expensive, make specific circuit.

Started nix build on my laptop. That was a bit hot on my lap. Spun up an debian lxc on my proxmox server. Built there. 
nix --extra-experimental-features nix-command     build ".#hydraJobs.duo-256"

It managed to get built
