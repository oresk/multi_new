Started with making the schematic outline. Just outline, so no pcb footprints, no particular values, no new symbols, etc. 

Need to send an email to bituo technic, to order RCD module, and see if they are going to be available in bulk. And also see how much is it going to cost. If expensive, make specific circuit.

nix --extra-experimental-features nix-command     build ".#hydraJobs.duo-256"
