This is a project that will create an EVSE but with a couple of experiments during development	
 - I will use as much AI help as possible during development
 - The project will use one of the new chips that are able to run linux (~1GHz, ~256MB ram) but have everything integrated (CPU, RAM, MCU for real time stuff)
 - Will still see what to use as the system to build the linux system, but will start with NixOS
 - I will try to document as much as I can during development
 - I will keep track of all the time spent

 Tools:
 - VScode
 - Kicad
 - NixOS
 -
